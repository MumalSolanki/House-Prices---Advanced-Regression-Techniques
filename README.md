Predicting House Prices in Ames, Iowa

Introduction:
This project aims to predict the sales price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, using a dataset provided by Kaggle. The dataset includes 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of the homes, such as size, condition, neighborhood, and amenities.

Goal:
The objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the sales price of a house based on its features.

Methodology:
1.Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify missing values, and explore potential correlations.
2.Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
3.Model Selection: Choose appropriate regression algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting) and evaluate their performance using metrics like RMSE.
4.Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters to achieve the best results.

Evaluation:
The model will be evaluated using Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the predicted and actual sales prices.

Model Performance:
Public Score: 0.18647
Leaderboard Rank: 3348
